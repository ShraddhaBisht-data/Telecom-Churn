# 📌 Project Overview

This project performs a **deep exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a telecom customer churn dataset to uncover:

- Hidden churn drivers
- Customer retention patterns
- Behavioral risk segments
- Revenue-risk relationships
- Service dissatisfaction indicators
- High-risk customer combinations

The project combines:

✅ Statistical Analysis  
✅ Business Intelligence  
✅ Customer Behavior Analytics  
✅ Advanced Visualization  
✅ Insight-Driven Storytelling  

---

# 🎯 Business Objective

Telecom companies lose significant revenue due to customer churn.

The goal of this project is to identify:

- Why customers leave
- Which customer groups are most vulnerable
- Which services improve retention
- How pricing affects churn
- Which combinations create extreme churn risk

# 📊 Exploratory Analysis

# 1️⃣ Univariate Analysis

Focused on understanding:

- Customer distribution
- Tenure patterns
- Pricing behavior
- Contract composition
- Service adoption

### Key Observation
New customers and month-to-month users dominate the churn population.

---

# 2️⃣ Bivariate Analysis

Studied feature relationships with churn:

| Analysis | Business Meaning |
|---|---|
| Contract vs Churn | Long-term contracts reduce churn |
| Internet Service vs Churn | Fiber customers churn heavily |
| Payment Method vs Churn | Electronic check users are unstable |
| Monthly Charges vs Churn | Expensive plans increase churn |
| Tech Support vs Churn | Support improves retention |

---

# 3️⃣ Multivariate Analysis

Identified dangerous customer combinations:

| High Risk Segment | Churn Risk |
|---|---|
| Month-to-month + Fiber Optic | Extremely High |
| Electronic Check + Monthly Contract | Severe |
| Senior Citizen + No Tech Support | Critical |
| Low Engagement Users | High |

---

# 🔥 Major Insights

## 📌 Contract Type is the Strongest Churn Driver

- Month-to-month customers show the highest churn
- Two-year contracts retain customers best
- Flexible plans increase switching behavior

---

## 📌 Fiber Optic Customers Churn More

- Premium customers have higher expectations
- Possible dissatisfaction with pricing or support

---

## 📌 High Charges Increase Churn

- Expensive monthly plans create higher exit probability
- Customers need stronger value perception

---

## 📌 Tech Support Improves Retention

- Customers with support services stay longer
- Lack of assistance increases frustration

---
